In this project I have tried to create an ecommerce website particularly for an electrical shop.
Using this website customer can order any available product online.
And if customer is not in their city where they want to get delivery then they can book any product by paying certain percentage of the actual price of any product they want to purchase and after that when they reach there city back then either they can collect ut from the shop. 
This sample website also contains a section which provides different types of services to the customer like for example if your fan gets dead by any reason then you can also book fan repair service from the website and machanic will come to your house for inspection of the fan.
I f you have any service related problem from the shop owner then you can give then feedback from contact us page on the website.
here is the link or the website:  [link text](https://r120dhiman.github.io/PowerPlaza/index.html)
